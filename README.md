# HaploPrep
This app identifies high-quality heterozygous SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) and prepares them for haplotype phasing by filtering variants based on population frequency, allelic balance, and sequencing depth from DNA-seq data.

_Note: Two outputs generated by this app (MpileupInformativeSNPInput.txt and InputVariantsforphasing.txt) are required inputs to run our [Single_Cell_Somatic_Mutation_Caller](https://github.com/ShainLab/Single_Cell_Somatic_Mutation_Caller) app._

## What does this app do?
1.	<ins>Initial filtering</ins> : Processes FreeBayes variant calls to identify heterozygous SNPs. Filters for SNPs with a population allele frequency ≥ 1% in the 1000 Genomes database and read allele frequency between 30-70% (heterozygous) based on FreeBayes estimates.  
2.	<ins>Depth analysis</ins> : Runs samtools mpileup on filtered SNPs to check read depth at each variant position and count reference and alternate allele reads.  
3.	<ins>Refinement</ins> : Further filters SNPs based on actual read data; filters for variants with read allele frequency between 40-60% and read depth ≥ 10. These are the "Informative SNPs".  
4.	<ins>Phasing</ins> : Uses GATK ReadBackedPhasing tool to phase these "Informative SNPs", determining which variants are on the same haplotype based on read information. Extracts chromosome position, reference/alternate alleles, and phased allele assignments indicating which allele is on each haplotype.

Note: Other variant callers aside from FreeBayes could be used, as long as they produce a vcf of candidate SNPs with similar column headers and structure. We provide sample input files to mimic for the user's convenience; please refer to test-dataset.

## What does this app output?
•	InformativeSNPs.txt : txt file of the FreeBayes data after initial filtering (output from step 1)  
•	MpileupOutput.txt : txt file containing results from samtools mpileup analysis (output from step 2)  
•	InformativeSNPs.vcf : vcf file created after the mpileup depth analysis and refinement containing only SNPs that passed additional filtering (output from step 3)  
•	MpileupInformativeSNPInput.txt : txt file containing the filtered SNPs used for phasing (output from step 3)  
•	phased_SNPs.vcf : vcf file output from GATK ReadBackedPhasing tool (output from step 4)  
•	InputVariantsforphasing.txt : txt file containing haplotype-resolved SNPs distinguishing maternal and paternal allelic combinations (output from step 4)

## What data is required for this app to run?
- DNAbam - A BAM file containing the DNA sequencing reads
- FBvcf - A VCF file from FreeBayes containing the initial variant calls
- FBtxt - A text file containing annovar annotation of the FreeBayes vcf
